# UFOs
Please view this link for my GitHub Page which hosts the Module 11 Challenge (Deliverable 1): https://michaelfoz.github.io/UCD_Module_11_UFOs/

Collectively, I have all of my files that I worked on throughout Module 11 in my 1st UFOs repository, and I have my actual project uploaded into my 2nd repository (UCD_Module_11_UFOs).

(My UFOs repository: https://github.com/michaelfoz/UFOs)


To avoid confusion, I created a this (2nd) repository for the Module 11 Challenge (I named this repository "UCD_Module_11_UFOs"). 

Deliverable 1 has instructions to rename the original app.js (which was created throughout Module 11) to app_1.js, 
and to rename the ufo_starterCode.js file to app.js for the Module 11 Challenge. 

Initially, I created a separate folder in my 1st repository [UFOs](https://github.com/michaelfoz/UFOs) that I named "[Module 11 Challenge](https://github.com/michaelfoz/UFOs/tree/main/Module%2011%20Challenge)" because I wanted to keep the files I worked on throughout the module separate from the new files that would be created/used for Deliverable 1. 
I wanted to keep them separate because I put in notes/comments within each files that would help me keep track of the changes/progression I made throughout the module and better understand the code.

I ran into the problem of not being able to specify or tell my GitHub Pages that I wanted to display or host my Module 11 Challenge folder and the finished index.html file it contains onto my website, which is why I created this 2nd repository (UCD_Module_11_UFOs). 
I tried to follow the instructions in this link ([Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)), but I still could not understand what to do.

After creating a new GitHub Pages for this repository, I was able to see that the GitHub Page was displaying my finished project. (Please let me know if there is a specific way to choose a root/docs in GitHub Pages).

# Overview
In Module 11, we learn about a front end development language, JavaScript.  This language is used to add functions and customizations (in this case, a dynamic webpage wherein a user is able to enter search criteria into a field, which prompts the webpage to load results that match the entered criteria). All of the data is initially stored in the JavaScript file data.js in the form of a list (var data = []). The JavaScript file app.js builds a table from this list. All of the data is displayed in the script of the html.index file which references both the data.js file and the app.js file.
