# UFOs

Collectively, I have all of my files that I worked on throughout Module 11 in my 1st UFOs repository, and I have my actual project uploaded into my 2nd repository (UCD_Module_11_UFOs).

My UFOs repository: https://github.com/michaelfoz/UFOs


To avoid confusion, I created a new (2nd) repository in my GitHub for the Module 11 Challenge (I named the repository "UCD_Module_11_UFOs"). 

The Deliverable 1 instruction has instructions rename the original app.js (which was created throughout Module 11) to app_1.js, and to rename the ufo_starterCode.js file to app.js for the Module 11 Challenge. 
Initially, I created a separate folder in my 1st repository (UFOs) that I named "Module 11 Challenge" because I wanted to keep the files I worked on throughout the module separate from the new files that would be created/used for Deliverable 1. 
I wanted to keep them separate because I put in notes/comments within each files that would help me keep track of the changes/progression I made throughout the module and better understand the code.

I ran into the problem of not being able to specify or tell my GitHub Pages that I wanted to display or host my Module 11 Challenge folder and the finished index.html file it contains onto my website, which is why I created the 2nd repository (UCD_Module_11_UFOs). 
I tried to follow the instructions in this link ([Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)), but I still could not understand what to do.

After creating a new GitHub Pages for this repository, I was able to see that the GitHub Page was displaying my fini
shed project. (Please let me know if there is a specific way to choose a root/docs in GitHub Pages).
